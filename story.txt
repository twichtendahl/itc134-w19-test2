The story is about a priest, a librarian, an alien entity, and a veterinarian who is constantly opposed by a dungeon delver. It starts in a blessed dukedom in a magical part of our universe. The story climaxes with a legal dispute. The future of warfare is a major part of this story.

The Librarian wakes up, and remembers having had a dream in which resolving pull requests was the same as resolving strain in ones frienships.
